          <p>Well, someone's in a good mood - well done! Now, I wonder what it is that has you so cheerful? ... And so will you when next you're feeling low.</p>
          <p>We won't sugarcoat it; now's the time to prepare for those times that you're feeling really down. How about writing something in the box below, to look back on when you need it most?</p>

        <p>Of course, we aren't going to force you to write anything, but we really encourage it: how about you write something good about life, yourself, or anything, whilst you're feeling upbeat? It really helps later on!</p>

        <h2>Feeling neutral can be good</h2>
        <p>When you suffer from a mental condition - or even if you don't! - it's important to look at what's <i>good</i> about how you are. There's always something good to think about; and if you can't find anything, it might just be really difficult to see.</p>
        <p>For example, you're currently feeling 'neutral' (or as some would say, 'a bit meh'), which is actually great for you! You're not feeling worthless; you're not feeling tearful; you're not feeling helpless. <b>You're feeling alright.</b></p>
        <p>After all, that's what neutral really means. <b>You're feeling alright</b>, even if it might be difficult for you to see that, or surprising to see it that way, but it's true.</p>

        <h2>Damn<span name="name"></span>...</h2>
        <p>What you're going through is tough, it really is. Whilst we can't claim to know fully how it is (since we aren't in your particular situation), many of we who use and even those who develop Eos suffer from similar issues; we want to be there for you.</p>
        <p>Whatever you're going through, the Eos community stands with you. The way forward, as is so often the case with these pesky mental conditions, is to push through and come out on the other side.</p>
        <p>Distract yourself: play video games; read a book; talk to a friend or someone you love. Just don't sit there wallowing, as dwelling only makes it worse.</p>
        <p>Trust us: if you do <i>something</i>, you'll feel <b>so much better</b>. It might take time, patience, and self-care, but we believe in you: <b>you can pull through this</b>.</p>

        <h2>Just breathe.</h2>
        <p>Right now, you're in a difficult state. What you're going through, the thoughts that are racing through your mind - it's incomprehensible. We've been there. But this state is amplified by fear, terror, and panic; so you need to <b>breathe</b>.</p>
        <p>There are a variety of helpful breathing methods, some of which you might have been told by friends or family in a similar situation, including the <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/stress-anxiety-depression/Pages/ways-relieve-stress.aspx" target="_blank">NHS breathing exercise</a>. Try one now, if you can; it might help.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, you should really consider reaching out to someone. We're here for you, but some people may find it more beneficial to speak to a friend, family member, or contact <a href="https://www.samaritans.org" target="_blank">the Samaritans</a>.</p>
        <p>Really, the goal you should have right now is simple: <b>distract yourself</b>. Be that by playing video games, or trying <a href="https://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/PDF/Self-Harm%20Distractions%20and%20Alternatives%20FINAL.pdf" target="_blank">one of the amazing recommendations from psychiatrists</a>.</p>

        <h2>About Eos</h2>
        <p>Eos is a free, open-source application to help with tracking moods, providing resources to help during your low moments, and consolidating all data into a presentable report at a moment's notice. This can help if you're working with a mental health professional (such as a cognitive-behavioural therapist), but is not, nor is it intended to, a replacement for qualified support.</p>
        <p>The source code for this free software is available <a href="https://github.com/lyrenhex/eos">on GitHub</a>.</p>
        <p>This app is a not-for-profit online progressive web application made with &hearts; by <a href="https://lyrenhex.com">Max Heaton</a>. &copy; 2017 - 2020.
          Version <span id="ver" name="version_number"></span></p>
        <h3>Version 3: Local</h3>
        <p>As of version 3, Eos no longer operates servers. All data is now stored locally, on-device, with the ability to import/export data if you need to change device / back up your data.</p>
        <p>The chat function is no longer available. I'd like to apologise for this if you liked the chat function; I'm always open to re-implementing it in future if there's demand, so please let me know if you would like a better version of the chat feature!</p>
        <p>Thank you for supporting Eos' goal to support you!</p>
        <h3>Support the project</h3>
        <p>Eos is free software, so there are <b>no payments required for any function within the app</b>. If, however, you'd like to make a voluntary contribution towards myself and the project, then you can either sponsor me on GitHub or give me a Ko-fi. Thank you!</p>
