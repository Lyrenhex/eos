      <h2>Support: always there</h2>
      <p>If it's just a bit of guidance on how to cope with what you're going through, Eos is there for you practically
        all the time.</p>
      <p>If your mood is low, we maintain a carefully curated list of suggestions for activities to do, which we'll
        present as appropriate, and we keep links with other helpful websites which we might recommend at times to help
        you get on the right track.</p>
      <p>We're with you every step of the way to good mental health.</p>
      <p>However, <b>Eos is not a substitute for qualified support</b>. The app is designed to complement your existing
        support. If you need help from another person, or you need help urgently, please contact a hotline, your local
        health service, or someone else who can help. (You can use the app even if you aren't under the care of a health
        professional, but please don't think it's a comprehensive care package - it's not! We also cannot provide
        medical advice.)</p>
    </div>
    <div class="block">
      <h2>Tracking: data, for better care</h2>
      <p>Whenever you use Eos by recording your mood (or, as we call it, 'logging your mood'), we store that data in
        your personal profile. This data is stored locally on your device (you can export/import if you need to back it
        up or change devices), and Eos works completely offline, so we <i>can't</i> share your data with anyone else; we
        don't have it!</p>
      <p>Displayed in an easy-to-understand graphical format, we take notice of the times that you've felt good or bad,
        and average this data out to get an idea of your mood over time. With this, you can use it to identify patterns
        in your mood; maybe you're always feeling down particularly on a Tuesday, so it's worth looking into what you do
        on Tuesday that's got you down? Or perhaps you suffer from a Seasonally Affective Disorder, and you're always
        low in November / December?</p>
      <p>Eos mood tracking is here to lift the burden of cataloging when you're low, so you can focus on what matters:
        using your coping strategies as soon as possible!</p>
